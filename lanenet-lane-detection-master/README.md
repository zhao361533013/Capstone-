# LaneNet-Lane-Detection
Use tensorflow to implement a Deep Neural Network for real time lane detection mainly based on the IEEE IV conference 
paper "Towards End-to-End Lane Detection: an Instance Segmentation Approach".You can refer to their paper for details 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05591. This model consists of a encoder-decoder stage, binary semantic segmentation stage 
and instance semantic segmentation using discriminative loss function for real time lane detection task.
